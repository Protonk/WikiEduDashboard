title: Edit an existing article
summary:
content: |
  If you're editing an existing article, a sandbox can be a good place to copy
  and paste a few sentences or a paragraph to develop. Do not try and overhaul
  an entire article from the sandbox.

  Instead, small additions (paragraphs at most) from your sandbox while in the
  "Edit" mode--references and other templates will break if you copy from the
  sandbox without editing first.
  
  If you're working with a new article that you've created, and doesn't exist on
  Wikipedia already, you can "move" your sandbox page into mainspace. In the
  next slides, we'll show you how.
